Node Calculator App
This is a calculator for the browser created with js, html, and css. Instead of needing to Google calculator, or have one with you at all times, you can simply execute the below commands and download the neccesary files into a folder and have one of your own!

Installation
Download and save each file into a folder on your PC. Make sure you go to the mentioned directory using the 'cd' command in a terminal window.

Run using the following command in the terminal window:
node calculator.js

The calculatior should now function in your browser and work.
With any issues feel free to contact me here on Github by leaving a comment.
